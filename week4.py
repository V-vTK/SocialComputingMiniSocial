        Exercise 4.3 Learning from othersâ€™ mistakes:
        Find two social platforms similar to Mini Social that have been under fire for an engineering,
          design or operation error that severely affected a large group of users. 
        Describe how we can learn from their mistakes and draft up a plan about how Mini Social can be improved learning from their mistakes.
        You do not need to write code in this exercise unless your plan includes a specific change to an algorithm or function. (5 points)        
        
        Discord has changed database architecture multiple times first from Mongo to Cassandra and then to ScyllaDB. These database changes were needed because of rapid platform growth. 
        Mini Social is currently small enough to be handled by a single SQL Lite database, but in the future it might be necessary to upgrade to something more scalable.
        It's also important to know and test the database architecture throroughly. After Discord's migration to Cassandra they had an big issue with how the messages were deleted. 
        Instead of directly deleting the messages Cassandra creates thombstones to effectively skip deleted records. This caused the JVM to overload and trigger the "stop-the-world" error. 
        For users this was seen as slowness and eventually full downtime. If the Discord developers had know they would have simply lowered the tombstone lifespan to 2 days avoiding the overload.

        When the time comes Mini Social should consider other database options like PostgreSQL, Cassandra or ScyllaDB. Transformations should be done well ahead and tested throroughly.
        With Blackbox testing the new database can be tested alongside the old one to compare query results and performance.

        Slack had an Major outage in 2025 due to database shards which caused API breakdowns. As these sharding errors grow over time it's important to monitor API performance and error rates. 
        Currently Mini Social does not have any monitoring or alerting in place. Any slowly creeping performance issues are only detected when it's too late.
        For improvement each API endpoint should be montored for latency and errors. There should also be testing and alerting that triggers when the service starts failing.
        Long downtime causes the users to be unhappy and less confident with the platform.
        
        Disclaimer: The Slack source is and 3rd party company, which offers API intelligence services, but it still had the best reporting on the issue.
